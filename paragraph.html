		<h3><b>Russia claims its military prevented a drone attack on Crimea</b></h3>
		
		<p>The Russian defense ministry claimed in a statement that the military prevented a "massive" 
		drone attack on Crimea.</p>		
		
		<p>"Six Ukrainian strike unmanned vehicles were shot down by air defense systems. Four more 
		Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles have been put out of action by means of electronic warfare," the statement published on Wednesday said.</P>
		
		<p>There were no casualties, according to the ministry, which did not release any photographic evidence of the drones, 
		nor provide details about the locations where the drones were allegedly brought down.</p>
		
		<p>On Tuesday, the Russian Ministry of Defense reported that electronic warfare systems had suppressed Ukrainian drones that tried to attack Krasnodar and neighboring Adygea in southwestern Russia. 
		Russian authorities also claimed that a Ukrainian drone had crashed near Kolomna in the Moscow region, but an image of the drone could not be geolocated.</P>

		<p>Germany will ramp up its ammunition production as well as weapon repair capacity to better support Ukraine’s fight against Russia's invasion, 
		the country’s leader said Wednesday. </p>
		
		<p>“The now one-year lasting support of Ukraine has also brought us the knowledge that enables us to ensure that there is also a sufficient supply, 
		with spare parts, that we have created repair capacities for the weapons used in the war, at locations outside of Ukraine,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said.</p>

		<p>“We will ensure that the production of ammunition is advanced, 
		both for the weapons that we have supplied ourselves and those that come from classic stocks that are available in eastern Europe,” Scholz continued.</P>
	
		<p>Berlin announced last week that it is sending another four Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. </p>
