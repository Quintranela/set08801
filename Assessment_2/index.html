			<h2>Hello, I am Quintranela</h2>
			
			<p style="font-size:100%;">As a little girl, I would love to watch my aunts in the kitchen baking a varity of pastries, my cousins 
			and I would anticipate the moment when will it be time to eat. The aroma of each individual pastries would light up the house. 
			Every ten minutes my cousins and I would pass by the oven waiting in anticipation. When they were finish, we couldn't wait to bite into one. 
			My favourite was the chheese roll, what a delight it was saving every taste.</p>
			
			<p>As the founder of 2S Pastry Delight, I have a vision, that every customer would experience what I felt as a child when I made that first bite.
			Every day, reshly made batches are made. Which was taught to me by my aunts because the taste is different.</p>
			
			<p>Our service level extends beyond just providing fine pastry goods to the public. I believe the more we know about each other, 
			the better we can work together to realize our common objectives.</p>
			
			<p>We currently provinding a walk in service but hoping to extend in the near future where customers can place their 
			orders online for either pick up or delivery.</p>
