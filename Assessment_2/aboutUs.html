			<h2>About Us</h2>
			
			<p style="font-size:100%;">2S Pastry Delight was named after my two children whose name begins with “S” they are an inspiration to the development of this company. 
				Ever so often, we would come together and make at least two of the items specified. Bread pudding was one of our favorites to make, 
				it was a great snack for home or school lunches.</p>
				
			<p style="font-size:100%;"> Growing up around my aunts, pastries were one of their specialties, so I became equipped and was exposed to baking and cooking at an early age. 
			    At first, making the dough for the pastries was not easy, but with practice and repetition it got easier. As an adult, 
				I became familiar with the process because indulging my children was worth it. Capturing the taste buds of an individual is a unique task. 
				When you think of pastry, your immediate thought is flour, butter and salt, the basics. One might think all fattening ingredients, 
				which may be true but each bit tickles the taste buds. Pastry has a different taste from bread, its crust is flaky with a crumbly texture. 
				It is light but with a firm crust to hold the filing.</p>
				
			<h4><i>Background Research</i></h4> 
				<p style="font-size:100%;">After researching a few food websites such as Qspices.com a virtual health food restaurant and Jehancancook.com a popular Guyanese 
				food recipe website. I was able to gather the basic about the important of aesthetics in food website building.</P>
